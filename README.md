Your Mission: Proposing a digital tool to optimize the student assessment process for the educational staff
- Supporting Teachers
- Enhancing Transparency for Parents
- Monitoring Children's Development

Most schools in the city of St.Gallen use a unified assessment grid instead of grades to evaluate students throughout the year. In every test, teachers document the results by marking a certain number of learning objectives/competency levels (placing crosses). While this practice is well-established, what’s missing is a modern digital tool that allows for

-	Entering evaluations,
-	Logging observations about students during lessons,
-	Accessing an overview of assessed competences over the year,
-	Selecting from a catalog of possible competencies to assess (interface with the curriculum),
-	Creating the ability to refine competency levels into specific learning objectives, individualized for each class, to enhance student evaluation.

What is the expected final product?
A contemporary digital tool that:
-	Facilitates the entry of evaluations and observations,
-	Provides an overview of assessed competencies,
-	Offers a selection from catalog of assessable competency levels tied to the curriculum,
-	Eases the process of deriving report card grades for teachers, offering a better alternative to the e. g. paper-based evaluation system, without automatically converting evaluations into grades,
-	Assists in demonstrating a student’s current progress during parent-teacher meetings.

## <p align="center"> Judging Criteria: </p>

Creativity & Innovation (20%)
- Is something completely new or does it at least take a new approach to an old problem?
- How creative or innovating is the idea?
- How did the team deal with existing solutions that try to solve the same problem and how does that position their solution?

Usefulness (20%)
- How important and relevant is the use case of the prototype to address an identified problem?
- Is it something people would actually use?
- Is the solution practical for a heterogenous group of people?
- Does it meet a real need for a heterogenous group of people?

Technical complexity (20%)
- How technically impressive / elaborate is the solution?
- Have complex techniques, algorithms or combinations of different data and components been used?
- Is appropriate technology and methodology used?

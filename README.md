Your Mission: Proposing a digital tool to optimize the student assessment process for the educational staff
- Supporting Teachers
- Enhancing Transparency for Parents
- Monitoring Children's Development

Most schools in the city of St.Gallen use a unified assessment grid instead of grades to evaluate students throughout the year. In every test, teachers document the results by marking a certain number of learning objectives/competency levels (placing crosses). While this practice is well-established, what’s missing is a modern digital tool that allows for

-	Entering evaluations,
-	Logging observations about students during lessons,
-	Accessing an overview of assessed competences over the year,
-	Selecting from a catalog of possible competencies to assess (interface with the curriculum),
-	Creating the ability to refine competency levels into specific learning objectives, individualized for each class, to enhance student evaluation.

What is the expected final product?
A contemporary digital tool that:
-	Facilitates the entry of evaluations and observations,
-	Provides an overview of assessed competencies,
-	Offers a selection from catalog of assessable competency levels tied to the curriculum,
-	Eases the process of deriving report card grades for teachers, offering a better alternative to the e. g. paper-based evaluation system, without automatically converting evaluations into grades,
-	Assists in demonstrating a student’s current progress during parent-teacher meetings.
